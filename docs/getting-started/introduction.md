## Getting Involved

Already a member? Head over to [the slack group to join the conversation](https://multifamilyhousing.slack.com)

### Joining the Community

We are thrilled you have decided to join our community. We have a growing [Slack community](https://multifamilyhousing.slack.com) where multifamily professionals discuss and share lessons and challenges from their experience in the industry and maintain social connections.

If you have not already, please [reach out](/join) to ask for an invite to our Slack group.

Once you have received your invite, please do the following:

* Read our code of conduct
* Enter your full name (this community will work best if we are all real humans), but feel free to add a custom “display name”
* Add a headline in the “what I do” box (can be “title @ company” or anything that helps people know who they are chatting with)
  * Important: if you are a vendor, it is required that you list your affiliation in your profile, at a minimum. If you are often discussing your product or your competitors’ products, it’s even better if you can highlight your affiliation in your display name.
* Add a profile photo
* Introduce yourself in the #introductions channel

In Slack, remember that channels are free. If you want to start a conversation on a topic that doesn’t have a channel dedicated to it, you can create a channel and invite others to join you.

### Participating in the Slack community

In general, in this community, we trust that everyone will behave in ways that they believe are appropriate. There are some hard-and-fast rules in our code of conduct, which we expect everyone to adhere to: specifically, rules prohibiting harassment and intolerant behavior. However, in general, we prefer to have guidelines for behavior rather than hard-and-fast rules in a way that promotes organic growth and discussion.

### Solicitation

This community is built for multifamily professionals to discuss the work that they do, the ideas that they have, and the things that they are learning. It is not intended to be lead generation for vendors or recruiters. Vendors can add enormous value to the community by being there to answer questions about their products when questions arise, but we do not want the community to become a sales-channel that drowns out organic discussion.

If someone mentions a problem that your product could help with, it is appropriate to add a comment to a thread saying “Hey I work at X and we have a solution that addresses this problem. PM me for information”. It is not appropriate to:

* Directly private-message someone about your product without being asked
* Contact someone outside of the slack channel (e.g., handing their contact info to your sales team).
