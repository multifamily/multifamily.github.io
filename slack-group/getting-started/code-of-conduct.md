We do not tolerate harassment in any form. If you believe someone is violating the LocallyOptimistic Code of Conduct (or, generally doing anything that makes you feel uncomfortable), please contact team within slack.

Our members strive to be friendly, patient, and welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

We expect everyone to:

* Be considerate
* Be respectful
* Participate in good faith

PLEASE be careful with your words and actions. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior is not acceptable and should be reported. This includes but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting sexually suggestive, explicit or violent material.
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

If anyone is breaking these rules, we will remove them from the community. We reserve the right to change and update this code of conduct at any point for any reason in order to ensure that our community stays happy, healthy, and welcoming.
